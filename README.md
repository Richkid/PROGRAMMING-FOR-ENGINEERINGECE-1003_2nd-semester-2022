# PROGRAMMING-FOR-ENGINEERINGECE-1003_2nd-semester-2022
The problem definition Since the start of your study at school, you have been taught to apply mathematical operations on numbers in the decimal system. However, with the advent of computers, one must recognize the importance of other number systems. For this assignment, you are being asked to write a C++ programme to carry out mathematical operations on the following number systems:  Binary  Octal  Decimal  Hexadecimal Your programme should include operations such as the following:  Addition  Subtraction  Multiplication  Conversion from one system to another. Your solution should include overloaded operators for each of the mathematical operators and should be able to carry out operations on objects of different classes. eg: octal = binary * octal
